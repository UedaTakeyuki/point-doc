<h3 style="color: #3a5169;">What is the <b>Point™️</b>?</h3>
Point is a token for premium features Atelier UEDA will launch soon. 

So far, Atelier Ueda has been offering services with a focus on being free of charge. To realize the free-of-charge, we adopt the architectures with low running costs. For example, the [Monitor](https://monitor.uedasoft.com/) is a remote monitoring system that uses still images updating regularly, which is an unusual architecture compared to general remote monitoring systems using moving images. You may have impressions of the tawdry and shabbiness of the still-image-based. However, I believed there is someone who agrees with the idea that providing free monitoring system is more valuable than a well-looking one.

I am still believing in the value of free-of-charge. However, when we were thinking about new features and new services, we noticed that even if such ones require unignorable running costs, it is more valuable to provide these as a premium instead of ignoring such one's realization.
