<h3 style="color: #3a5169;">What is the <b>Point™️</b>?</h3>
Point is a token for premium features Atelier UEDA will launch soon. 

So far, Atelier Ueda has been offering services with a focus on being free-of-charge. by adopting architectures that request inexpensive running costs.  For example, the [Monitor](https://monitor.uedasoft.com/) is a remote monitoring system that uses still images updating regularly, which is an unusual architecture compared to general remote monitoring systems using moving images. You may have impressions of the tawdry and shabbiness of the still-image-based remote monitoring system. You may also have a question about why Atelier UEDA bothers to provide such a service. However, we believe that choosing this cheap architecture is the source of the value of free of charge. Also, we believe in the value of providing a free-of-charge remote monitoring system.

We are still believing in the value of free-of-charge. However, when we were thinking about new features and new services, we noticed that even if such ones require unignorable running costs, it is more valuable to provide these as a premium instead of ignoring such one's realization.
