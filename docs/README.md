<h3 style="color: #3a5169;">What is the <b>Point™️</b>?</h3>
Point is a token for premium features Atelier UEDA will launch soon. So far, Atelier Ueda has been offering free-of-charge services like [Monitor](https://monitor.uedasoft.com/) or [Koshinto](https://koshinto.uedasoft.com/docs/) by adopting architectures that request inexpensive running costs.  For example, the [Monitor](https://monitor.uedasoft.com/) is a remote monitoring system that uses still images updating regularly, which is an unusual architecture compared to general remote monitoring systems using moving images.
