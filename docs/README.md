<h3 style="color: #3a5169;">What is the <b>Point™️</b>?</h3>
Point is a token for premium features that Atelier UEDA will launch soon. 

So far, Atelier Ueda has been offering services with a focus on being free of charge. To realize the free-of-charge, we adopt the architectures with low running costs. For example, the [Monitor](https://monitor.uedasoft.com/) is a remote monitoring system that uses still images updating regularly, which is an unusual architecture compared to general remote monitoring systems using moving images. You may have impressions of the tawdry and shabbiness of the still-image-based. However, it is my pleasure if there is someone who prefers free monitoring system to a well-looking one.

Even so, there cannot be ignored features even if their running cost is unignorable. In such a case, it is reasonable and common to provide it as a freemium service, where the basic features are free, and the features with high running cost as premium features to ask to share the cost. The problem is that the implementation of the billing is a laborious task, and the number of implementation parts increases for each premium feature. This makes it difficult to fast-release.

This is why the Point is necessary. By introducing the Point, which are tokens common to Atelier Ueda, it is possible to reduce the payment process to just one place to purchase the Point.
